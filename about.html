        <h2>History of Charlotte</h2>
        <p>Have you ever wondered why Charlotte defies most other cities by calling downtown “Uptown?” Why the NBA team's mascot is an angry hornet? Or why you'll see a crown on so much of the city's insignia?
            Charlotte looks like a brand new city, but there's a lot of history here. Its roots run deep in the Old South, way back before the American Revolution. As the New South dawned after the Civil War, Charlotte took off—first as a railroad junction and then as a cotton mill hub.
            Today, it is one of America's largest banking centers and one of the nation's fastest-growing metropolitan areas. Newcomers roll in daily from across the United States and around the globe.
            There's a sense of possibility and of change so strong that it's energizing—and magnetic. Charlotte is a place that asks you to dig in, to find connections and to make history here yourself.</p>
