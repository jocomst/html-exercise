        <h2>Shortage info</h2>
        <p>The state has not seen much of a budge in the number of gas stations regaining fuel in the last day, according to GasBuddy which is now reporting 58 percent of North Carolina stations are without gas.
            North Carolina has hovered somewhere between the late 50s percentile as of Sunday -- an improvement from the past couple of days.
            So far, both Durham and Chapel Hill-Carrboro Schools plan to make a return to the classrooms on Monday after having to cancel in-person learning due to the shortage.
            On Saturday, Colonial Pipeline reiterated that it has since restarted it is back up and running after having to restart its pipeline system on Wednesday. The company says it will take "several days" for a return to normal.</p>
